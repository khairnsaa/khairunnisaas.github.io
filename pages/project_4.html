            <h3>Brief</h3>
            <p>
              <a target="_blank" href="https://www.biodrop.io">BioDrop</a> is an
              open source project that initiated by eddie on github. It's A
              platform where people in tech can have a single hub to showcase
              their content in order to accelerate their career, whilst
              contributing to an Open Source project and being part of a
              community that has a say in where the project is going.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the way this is my first time doing a "real code" contribution
              to the open source project. I was a coder for a few years but i
              didn't had a thought to do some open source contribution. But then
              i read some of the people blogs about their journey to contribute
              for open source. And i want to be like them. so i'm searching what
              kind of project i want to contribute, and i found biodrop. i think
              this is the perfect project for me to contribute as a newbie,
              because when i do some research about this project, this is not
              somekind of hard project. it's just a website where you can share
              all the link you have.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, i have wrote my own blog for this specific journey.

            <p>
              What i did for this project is not that hard. just fixing a little
              margin so the interface didn't look so bad.
