            <h3>Brief</h3>
            <p>
              The first time i joined
              <a href="https://bvk.co.id">PT. Buana Varia Komputama</a>, i got
              assigned to the one of their project called "Kimia Farma
              Diagnostik". Kimia Farma was one of the biggest pharmacy in
              Indonesia. It was a new project for the company, so when i got in,
              the project was also just got started to develop. In this project
              my resposibilites is to create a interface that was designed by
              UI/UX Design team and integrate the application with the backend.
              Some feature that i have been working on like, electrical medical
              record, patient registration, and create billing for the patient.

            <h3>Takeaway</h3>
            <p>
              There are a few libraries that this project used and i never used
              it before. So, when i got assigned it the first time, i got a
              little bit overwhelmed & panic because i didn't know about it.
              Some libraries that i never used before is react recoil, react
              hook form and react query (or known as tanstack query). And also,
              this project is using Next JS. Even Though i have an experience of
              using React JS, but i didn't know much about Next JS and what
              server side rendering is. But luckily, all my teammate is a very
              nice people, they help me to figure it out all the things that i
              didn't know before. So, thanks to all my teammate to help me learn
              something new.
