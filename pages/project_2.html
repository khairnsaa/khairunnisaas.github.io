            <p>
              To celebrate the end of world cup 2022, i have a plan to create
              something. This World Cup Quizzes was not my first plan. My first
              plan is to create a mini game that work in browser. But i don't
              think i had enough time to make it since i got sick during the
              world cup. And i'm afraid if i still using that plan, i need to
              push back the release date, So i changed it to this idea. This
              project is really simple, it's just a basic quiz game. There will
              be a few question of multiple choices. I have deployed this
              project to the netlify so you guys could play it.

              Even though previously i said that this is a simple project, but i
              still learn new things from creating this project. there's some
              new tech that i used for this project, One of which is
              <a href="https://pocketbase.io">Pocketbase</a>. Pocketbase is an
              open source backend, So i don't need to create my own API for this
              project.
